Bilby works on the bilby branch, and even on 9bbb5c94.
It does not work anymore on commit 7f8b944c36d5e5b6b8dd3 
even on commit e9edc2e8

It seems that the problem is the fsop_init function in the generated theory file CorresProof.
The fsop.cogent file in this directory is a minimal version of the original file impl/fs/bilby/cogent/src/fsop.cogent
that contains the function fsop_init  and its dependencies.

Usage: replace the original fsop.cogent with this one, then 
make verification in impl/fs/bilby/cogent, and checkAllRefine.sh

When git bisecting to get the last working commit, beware that Isabelle will not reload the theory
files if the haven't changed, although the generated C file that they parse has changed.
To force a reload, one can remove the ACInstall cache heap somewhere under ~/.isabelle

One could also use external_file so that Isabelle keeps track of the changes when deciding
whether or not to reload
