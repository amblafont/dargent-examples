Go in a subdirectory of an example, and then:
. ../compiles.sh branche name_of_cogent_file

branche can be master, dargent, dargentisa (my branch)

-------------------------
Currently, the branch dargentisa succeeds on a simple example with layout
(identity) and fails with a slightly more complicated one (onefield, taking
the projection of a singleton record)

--------------------------
TODO: THe C compilation generates useless masks in the parts of the getters for custom layouts

TODO: check examples with different layouts for the same record (I fear a clash in the table file, as the layout is always undefined)
TODO: make Complements take statements about heap_update as arguments

some working examples:
bucket/nested_boxed.cogent
