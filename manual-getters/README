These are small examples where I manually generate the getters/setters and 
their related properties. Then, I try to make the automatic proof work.
This generation will be dealt with later, either from the Haskell side
(Zilin could help me for this), or from the ML side.

Pb: onefield_no_layout Corres Proof fails with the dargentbranch (commit 08e5ff0915afca0e83b8aa702314e7aacd)
it is not in A normal form

01/05 onefield_bits works with the dargentisa branch

TODO: try nested records, and nested with # inside (done: nested_unboxed_record.cogent)
try with variants

try with RECORDS with multiple fields

28/05 onefield_bits and nested_field works with the automatic generation lemma (it remains to prove automatically the properties of get/set)
But for nested_field, I need to reorder the lemmas for member: ReadOnly should appear first.
TODO: test this order condition for other lemmas. In particular, what if Member Writable appears first?
